Agiletimbres is a software synthesizer designed to work on [SHARP electronic dictionary](http://www.sharp.co.jp/edictionary/)
(which uses Windows Embedded CE 6.0 as its operating system).
Because it is designed to be cross-platform as much as possible, it will run on other platforms including Windows and Mac OS X.
